/*
 * The contract between picoruby-asterism-zenoh and its TCP links (src/zp_tcp_posix.c,
 * ports/esp32/zp_tcp_esp32.c), which replace zenoh-pico's own.
 *
 * zenoh-pico's client read path treats "the peer closed the connection" the
 * same as "nothing to read yet", so on its own a session only notices a lost
 * router when the lease expires or a send fails. The links therefore keep the
 * state of the connection in the socket itself (no extra memory): a send that
 * cannot finish within PICORUBY_ZENOH_SEND_TIMEOUT_MS shuts the socket down
 * (a half-written message would corrupt the stream anyway), and
 * zp_tcp_socket_closed() reports a socket whose peer has closed it, that has
 * failed, or that was shut down that way. The gem asks after every poll and
 * put, and closes the session when it is true.
